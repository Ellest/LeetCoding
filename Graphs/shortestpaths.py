# - Time complexity: O(VE) - visits all edges E, V-1 times.
# - Space complexity: O(V) - stores distance to each V
# - Can extend to get paths to all in O(V^2 * E) which can get slower than Floyd Warshall's O(V^3)
# - Need to run the loop V-1 times due to the fact that in the worst case,
#   it will take V-1 loops to fully discover (relax) the path to a certain vertex.
#   This is due to the algorithm only updating routes that have been "discovered"
# - Detect negative weight cycles
