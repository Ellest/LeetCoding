"""
You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, 
that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices 
of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word 
in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

For example, given:
s: "barfoothefoobarman"
words: ["foo", "bar"]

You should return the indices: [0,9].
(order does not matter).
